# Features

## Wellbeing Score
We have identified a number of metrics that can help in accurately understanding the wellness of an employee which ranges from professional details to personal details. We have curated around 30 metrics that will give us a deep insight of the employees overall wellbeing and provide a wholistic wellbeing score.​

## Prediction
We will be using various machine learning models to effectively analyse the employee data. We have used feed forward neural networks to accurately calculate the weights of each parameter/metric and an LSTM model to give a precise predicion of future wellbeing scores.

## Sentimental Analysis
We have a sentimental analysis feature which will provide additional information about the mental and social wellbeing of an employee. We are using Twitter to analyse an employees tweets and provide a mood analysis.

## Wellness Program
The metrics collected will provide two fold information that will aid in creating strategies for wellness programs as manager-employe compatability and employee-employee compatability along with their wellness levels will be accurately shown through a number of graphs.​

# Running the Project

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
